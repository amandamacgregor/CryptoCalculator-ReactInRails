*Using RoR and React, as well as pinging outside API for up to date value of various cryptocurrencies, following the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpYPLUO3QcI I built out a 98% functioning portfolio app.  .reduce is causing major block when working with props, so despite a few hours troubleshooting I can't get a TOTAL portfolio value to print (TypeError).

I didn't style this myself - I used the css code straight from the source.
